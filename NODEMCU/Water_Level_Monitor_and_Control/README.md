# Water Level Monitoring and Automatic Pump Control System

## Overview

This project is a NodeMCU based Water Level Monitoring and Automatic Pump Control System designed to monitor the water level inside a tank using an ultrasonic sensor, display the water level using an LED bar graph through the PCA9555D I2C I/O expander, and automatically control a water pump based on the tank level.

The system continuously measures the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the water surface, converts the reading into a percentage value, and updates the LED graph accordingly.

The pump automatically turns ON when the water level falls below 20% and turns OFF once the tank reaches 100%.

The project includes:

- NodeMCU ESP8266 controller
- Ultrasonic water level sensing
- Automatic water pump control
- PCA9555D LED bar graph display
- Real-time percentage monitoring
- Serial Monitor debugging output
- I2C communication
- Tank percentage mapping logic

# System Operation

## General Workflow

1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the water distance.
2. The measured distance is converted into water level percentage.
3. The LED graph updates according to the water level.
4. When the level drops below 20%, the relay activates the pump.
5. The pump continues filling the tank.
6. Once the tank reaches 100%, the pump turns OFF automatically.
7. The Serial Monitor displays:
   - Distance in centimeters
   - Water percentage
   - Pump status

---

# Water Level Logic

The system maps the measured ultrasonic distance into percentage values.

## Tank Logic

- Smaller distance = Higher water level
- Larger distance = Lower water level

Example:

| Distance | Water Level |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 5 cm | 100% |
| 25 cm | 50% |
| 50 cm | 0% |

---

# Pump Logic

## Pump ON Condition

The pump turns ON when:

```text
Water Level <= 20%
```

## Pump OFF Condition

The pump turns OFF when:

```text
Water Level >= 100%
```

This prevents:

- Tank overflow
- Dry running conditions
- Constant relay switching

---

# LED Graph Operation

The LEDs operate as a bar graph display.

## Behavior

- Low water level lights fewer LEDs
- High water level lights more LEDs
- Full tank lights all LEDs
- Empty tank lights only the lowest level indicator

This allows quick visual monitoring of tank level.

---

# Serial Monitor Output

The Serial Monitor displays live information.

Example:

```text
Distance: 18 cm | Level: 64% | Pump: ON
```

This helps during:

- Calibration
- Troubleshooting
- Tank testing
- Sensor verification

# Operating Guide

## Normal Operation

1. Power the NodeMCU.
2. The ultrasonic sensor begins reading the tank level.
3. The LED graph updates automatically.
4. If the tank level drops below 20%, the pump starts automatically.
5. When the tank becomes full, the pump stops automatically.
6. The Serial Monitor continuously displays system information.

# Troubleshooting

## Ultrasonic Read Error

Possible causes:

- Sensor wiring issue
- Object outside detection range
- Sensor facing incorrect direction
- Weak power supply

---

## LEDs Not Responding

- Check PCA9555D I2C wiring
- Confirm I2C address is `0x20`
- Verify SDA and SCL connections
- Check LED polarity

---

## Pump Not Turning ON

- Confirm relay wiring
- Check pump power supply
- Verify relay trigger logic
- Confirm water level is below 20%

---

## Pump Not Turning OFF

- Confirm ultrasonic readings
- Check water level mapping values
- Verify tank depth configuration

---

# Safety Notes

- Use a proper power supply for the pump
- Isolate relay high-voltage wiring
- Avoid water contact with electronics
- Secure all I2C and sensor wiring
- Use proper grounding

# Smart Posture Corrector

## Overview

This project is a modular Smart Posture Corrector System built around the ESP32-WROOM-32 using a structured PlatformIO architecture.

The system monitors the user posture orientation using the MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer sensor and intelligently detects bad posture based on a calibrated body reference angle.

When poor posture is maintained for a configured duration, the system activates:

- Vibration motor feedback
- Audible buzzer alert
- LED fault indication

The system also supports:

- Persistent posture calibration storage
- Battery monitoring
- SD card logging
- Sleep/wake power management
- Breathing heartbeat LED effect
- Non-blocking firmware design

The posture calibration is automatically saved using ESP32 Preferences memory so the device remembers the user's posture reference angle after restart or power loss.

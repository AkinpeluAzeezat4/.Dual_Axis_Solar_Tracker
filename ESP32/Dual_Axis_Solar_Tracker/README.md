# Dual Axis Solar Tracker

## Overview

This project is a Dual Axis Solar Tracking System built using the ESP32-WROOM-32UE microcontroller and an L298D motor driver module. The system automatically tracks the direction of sunlight using four LDR sensors and positions the solar panel for maximum light exposure using two DC motors.

The tracker also includes:
- Automatic night detection and sleep mode
- Rotary encoder based calibration and control
- Direction indication LEDs
- Manual movement mode
- Saved calibration settings using ESP32 Preferences (NVS)

The project is designed using a modular architecture for easier maintenance, debugging, scalability, and future upgrades.

# Rotary Encoder Operation

## Short Press
Cycles through:
- AUTO_TRACK
- MANUAL_AZIMUTH
- MANUAL_ELEVATION
- CALIBRATE_DEADBAND
- CALIBRATE_NIGHT

## Long Press
Returns system to AUTO_TRACK mode.

## Rotation Functions

### MANUAL_AZIMUTH
Moves panel left and right.

### MANUAL_ELEVATION
Moves panel up and down.

### CALIBRATE_DEADBAND
Adjusts tracking sensitivity.

### CALIBRATE_NIGHT
Adjusts night detection threshold.

---

# Operating Guide

## Power On

1. Power the ESP32 and L298D driver.
2. Ensure all LDRs are exposed to light.
3. The status LED should begin breathing.
4. The system starts in AUTO_TRACK mode.

---

## Automatic Tracking

The system compares:
- Left vs Right light intensity
- Top vs Bottom light intensity

The motors automatically reposition the solar panel toward the strongest light source.

---

## Manual Control

Use short press to enter:
- MANUAL_AZIMUTH
- MANUAL_ELEVATION

Rotate the encoder to move the panel manually.

---

## Calibration

### Deadband Calibration

Higher deadband:
- Less motor movement
- Less jitter

Lower deadband:
- Faster response
- Higher sensitivity

### Night Threshold Calibration

Adjusts the darkness level required before entering sleep mode.

---

# Sleep Mode

When darkness is detected:
- Motors stop
- LEDs turn off
- ESP32 enters deep sleep

Wake sources:
- Rotary encoder button
- Timer wakeup

---

# PWM Motor Control

PWM is used on:
- GPIO25
- GPIO14

This provides:
- Smooth movement
- Adjustable speed
- Reduced motor stress

---

# Important Notes

- Use a separate motor power supply.
- Do not power motors directly from the ESP32.
- All grounds must be connected together.
- Use voltage dividers for all LDRs.
- GPIO34–39 are input-only pins.
- GPIO4 is ADC2 and may conflict with WiFi usage.

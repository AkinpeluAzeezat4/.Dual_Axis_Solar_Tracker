# Smart Robotic Car With PID Control

## Overview

This project is a Smart Robotic Car built around the ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller. I designed the system to move autonomously, detect obstacles, reduce speed gradually when approaching an object, scan the surrounding area with a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor, and decide the best turning direction using a controlled driving algorithm.

The car uses a Yahboom 4-Channel Motor Drive Module to control four L-shape geared 520 DC motors. The ESP32 communicates with the motor driver through UART. A gyroscope sensor is used for motion feedback, yaw estimation, turning stability, and PID-assisted control. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor so that the car can scan left, center, and right before making a turn.

The project also includes battery monitoring, four battery level indicator LEDs, a breathing power indicator LED, and a local web dashboard for viewing important system information such as distance, speed, battery status, turning mode, servo angle, and motion data.

The firmware is structured using a modular PlatformIO architecture so that each section of the system can be tested, maintained, and upgraded independently.

The system includes:

- ESP32-WROOM-32 main controller
- Yahboom 4-Channel Motor Drive Module
- Four L-shape geared 520 DC motors

# System Operation

## Power On

1. Power the ESP32, Yahboom motor driver, sensors, and motor supply.
2. The power indicator LED on GPIO2 starts breathing.
3. The battery level LEDs show the current battery percentage.
4. The ESP32 starts the WiFi access point for the web dashboard.
5. The Yahboom driver is configured through UART.
6. The ultrasonic sensor, servo, and gyroscope modules start running.
7. The car enters autonomous mode by default.

---

# Autonomous Driving Logic

The car is designed to behave like a simple self-driving robot car.

## Normal Forward Movement

When the front distance is safe:

- The servo remains centered.
- The car moves forward.
- Speed is controlled based on the measured distance.
- The farther the obstacle, the faster the car can move.
- The closer the obstacle, the slower the car moves.

---

## Gradual Speed Reduction

The car does not wait until it is very close to an obstacle before stopping.

Instead:

- At far distance, the car moves at normal speed.
- At medium distance, speed is reduced.
- At close distance, speed is reduced further.
- At stop distance, the car stops and begins obstacle scanning.

This makes the movement smoother and closer to a normal self-driving behavior.

---

## Obstacle Scan Behavior

When the car detects that an obstacle is too close:

1. The car stops.
2. The servo turns the ultrasonic sensor to the right.
3. The car reads the right-side distance.
4. The servo turns the ultrasonic sensor to the left.
5. The car reads the left-side distance.
6. The servo returns to center.
7. The car decides the best direction.

The system prefers a right turn when the right side is clear. If the right side is blocked but the left side is clearer, the car turns left.

---

## PID Speed Control

The PID speed control helps the car reduce speed smoothly as the obstacle distance changes.

The distance control uses:

- Setpoint distance
- Measured ultrasonic distance
- Error between desired and actual distance
- PID correction value

This correction is used to adjust the forward speed instead of suddenly stopping the car.

---

## PID Turn Control

The PID turn control uses gyroscope yaw feedback to make turning more stable.

During a turn:

- The system stores the starting yaw angle.
- A target yaw angle is selected.
- The car rotates until the target angle is reached.
- PID correction helps reduce overshoot.
- The car stops turning when the turn is complete.

This gives better control than turning for a fixed time only.

---

# Driving Modes

## Auto Mode

In auto mode, the robot controls itself using:

- Ultrasonic distance
- Servo scan result
- Gyroscope yaw
- PID control
- Battery safety condition

---

## Manual Mode

In manual mode, I can control the car from the web dashboard using:

- Forward
- Backward
- Left
- Right
- Stop

Manual mode is useful for testing motors, direction, and movement before enabling full autonomous behavior.

---

## Idle Mode

In idle mode:

- The motors are stopped.
- Sensors can still update.
- The web dashboard can still display system values.

---

# Web Dashboard

The ESP32 creates a local WiFi Access Point for monitoring and control.

## Access Point

```text
SSID: SmartCar_PID
Password: *****
IP Address: 192.168.4.1
```

## Dashboard Information

The dashboard displays:

- Current driving mode
- Front obstacle distance
- Right scan distance
- Left scan distance
- Current motor speed
- Left and right motor command
- Servo angle

- Gyroscope pitch
- Gyroscope roll
- Gyroscope yaw
- Motion status
- Yahboom motor driver status

## Dashboard Controls

The dashboard provides:

- Auto mode button
- Manual mode button
- Stop button
- Forward button
- Backward button
- Left turn button
- Right turn button

---

# Battery Monitoring

The battery voltage is read through the ESP32 ADC pin.

The system calculates:

- Battery voltage
- Battery percentage
- Low battery condition

The four battery LEDs show the approximate charge level:

| Battery Percentage | LED Display |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| 0% - 24% | All battery LEDs OFF |
| 25% - 49% | LED1 ON |
| 50% - 74% | LED1 + LED2 ON |
| 75% - 94% | LED1 + LED2 + LED3 ON |
| 95% - 100% | LED1 + LED2 + LED3 + LED4 ON |

---

# Power Indicator

The power indicator LED is connected to GPIO2.

This LED is used only as a breathing status indicator. It is separate from the four battery level LEDs.

---

# Yahboom Motor Driver Notes

The Yahboom motor driver is controlled through UART in this project.

The ESP32 sends motor commands to the driver using serial command frames.

Example command types:

```text
$pwm:300,300,300,300#
$pwm:0,0,0,0#
$spd:300,300,300,300#
$spd:0,0,0,0#
```

For the L-shape geared 520 motors, the motor configuration used is:

```text
Motor Type: 1
Motor Phase: 40
Motor Line: 11
Wheel Diameter: 67.00
Deadzone: 1900
```

Only UART should be used for the Yahboom driver in this project. I2C should not be used at the same time as UART.

---

# Important Electrical Notes

- Do not power motors directly from the ESP32.
- Use a proper battery or power supply for the Yahboom motor driver.
- Use a common GND between the ESP32 and Yahboom driver.
- Use a level shifter or voltage divider from Yahboom TX to ESP32 RX.
- Do not connect 5V logic directly to ESP32 GPIO pins.
- Power the servo from a proper 5V supply.
- Add a capacitor near the servo power pins to reduce voltage drops.
- Add a large capacitor near the motor driver power input.
- Keep motor wires away from I2C and sensor signal wires where possible.
- If using HC-SR04, level-shift the ECHO signal before ESP32 GPIO26.

- Confirm the motor battery voltage is suitable for the motors.
- Confirm the motors are connected to the correct output terminals.
- Confirm common GND between ESP32 and Yahboom driver.
- Confirm ESP32 TX goes to Yahboom RX and Yahboom TX goes to ESP32 RX through level shifting.
- Test the Yahboom board alone through Type-C serial first.
- Make sure no other module is using GPIO16 and GPIO17 UART pins.
- Try both `$pwm` and `$spd` commands depending on the driver firmware.

---

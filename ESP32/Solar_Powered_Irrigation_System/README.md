# System Operation

## Power On

1. Power the ESP32 and all connected modules.
2. The LCD displays the system status.
3. Saved calibration values are loaded from ESP32 Preferences memory.
4. The system enters autonomous mode automatically.
5. Both pumps remain controlled by the system logic.

---

# Autonomous Control Logic

## Overhead Tank Pump

The overhead tank pump is responsible for filling the overhead tank.

The tank pump turns ON when:

- The overhead tank level is below the saved low tank threshold.
- The ultrasonic sensor reading is valid.
- The system is not in setup mode.

The tank pump turns OFF when:

- The overhead tank reaches the saved full tank threshold.
- The maximum tank pump runtime is exceeded.
- The ultrasonic sensor fails.
- The system enters setup mode.

This protects the system from overflow and pump damage.

---

## Irrigation Sprinkler Pump

The irrigation pump is responsible for watering the farm or garden through the sprinkler system.

The irrigation pump turns ON when:

- The soil moisture level is below the saved dry threshold.
- The overhead tank has enough water.
- The system is not in setup mode.
- The irrigation pause time has completed.

The irrigation pump turns OFF when:

- The soil is wet enough.
- The irrigation run time is completed.
- The overhead tank becomes low.
- The ultrasonic sensor reports an invalid reading.
- The system enters setup mode.

This prevents dry-run operation and avoids wasting water.

---

# Tank Level Monitoring

The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the top of the tank to the water surface.

During calibration:

- The full tank distance is saved.
- The empty or low tank reference distance is saved.

The system uses these saved values to calculate the tank level percentage.

Example behavior:

- Smaller distance means the water is closer to the sensor, so the tank is fuller.
- Larger distance means the water is farther from the sensor, so the tank is lower.

---

# Buzzer Alert

The buzzer alerts the user when the system detects an important condition.

The buzzer can activate when:

- The overhead tank level is low.
- The ultrasonic sensor reading is invalid.
- The tank pump runtime exceeds the safety limit.
- The battery level is low.

---

# Rotary Encoder Operation

The rotary encoder is used for setup, calibration, and menu control.

## Entering Setup Mode

Press and hold the encoder button for about 5 seconds.

When setup mode is entered:

- Both pumps are turned OFF for safety.
- The LCD shows the setup menu.
- The system pauses autonomous pump control.

## Menu Navigation

- Rotate encoder clockwise to move forward.
- Rotate encoder anticlockwise to move backward.
- Short press to select or edit an item.
- Rotate while editing to increase or decrease the selected value.
- Press again to save the selected value.
- Long press to save and exit setup mode.

---

# Setup Menu

The setup menu allows the system to be calibrated directly from the device.

## Available Setup Options

1. Calibrate Full Tank
2. Calibrate Empty / Low Tank
3. Set Low Tank Level
4. Set Full Stop Level
5. Set Battery Empty Voltage
6. Set Battery Full Voltage
7. Set Battery Scale Factor
8. Set Soil Dry Threshold
9. Set Irrigation Run Time
10. Set Irrigation Pause Time
11. Set Tank Pump Max Runtime
12. Save and Exit
13. Reset Defaults

---

# Calibration Guide

## Full Tank Calibration

1. Fill the overhead tank to the desired full level.
2. Enter setup mode.
3. Select `Calibrate Full Tank`.
4. Save the current ultrasonic distance.
5. The system will use this value as the full tank reference.

---

## Empty / Low Tank Calibration

1. Allow the tank to reach the desired low or empty level.
2. Enter setup mode.
3. Select `Calibrate Empty / Low Tank`.
4. Save the current ultrasonic distance.
5. The system will use this value as the low tank reference.

---

## Low Tank Threshold

This value determines when the system should treat the tank as low.

When the tank level falls below this threshold:

- The irrigation pump is stopped.
- The tank pump is allowed to start.
- The buzzer can alert the user.

---

## Full Stop Threshold

This value determines when the tank pump should stop filling the overhead tank.

When the tank reaches this threshold:

- The tank pump turns OFF.
- Overflow is prevented.

---

## Battery Calibration

Battery calibration allows the system to show a more accurate battery percentage.

The setup menu includes:

- Battery empty voltage
- Battery full voltage
- Battery scale factor

The scale factor should match the voltage divider used on the battery sensing circuit.

---

## Soil Moisture Calibration

The soil dry threshold determines when the irrigation pump should turn ON.

A lower or higher value may be required depending on the soil sensor type, soil condition, and installation depth.

---

# Saved Settings

All setup values are saved in ESP32 Preferences memory.

This means:

- Calibration is not lost after power off.
- The system starts with the last saved values.
- The device does not need to be calibrated every time it boots.
- Values only change when setup mode is used again.

---

# Safety Behavior

## Dry-Run Protection

The irrigation pump is stopped when the overhead tank is low.

This prevents the sprinkler pump from running without water.

---

## Overflow Protection

The tank pump is stopped when the overhead tank reaches the full stop threshold.

This prevents water overflow.

---

## Setup Mode Protection

Both pumps are forced OFF when setup mode is active.

This makes calibration safer.

---

## Sensor Fault Protection

If the ultrasonic sensor gives an invalid reading:

- Pump operation is stopped.
- The buzzer alerts the user.
- The LCD can show the sensor fault condition.

---

# Operating Guide

## Normal Operation

1. Power the system.
2. Allow the LCD to show the startup screen.
3. The system loads saved settings.
4. The system monitors the tank, soil, battery, and solar input.
5. The tank pump fills the overhead tank when needed.
6. The sprinkler pump irrigates only when the soil is dry and enough water is available.

---

## First-Time Setup

1. Install all sensors and pumps correctly.
2. Fill the overhead tank to the full level and calibrate full tank.
3. Allow the tank to reach the desired low level and calibrate low tank.
4. Set the low tank percentage.
5. Set the full stop percentage.
6. Calibrate the battery empty and full voltages.
7. Set the soil dry threshold.
8. Save and exit setup mode.
9. Restart the system and confirm that saved values are retained.

---

## Daily Use

The system is designed to run by itself.

The user only needs to check:

- Water source availability
- Battery condition
- Solar charging condition
- Pump operation
- Sensor wiring
- LCD status messages

---

# Important Notes

- Do not power pumps directly from the ESP32.
- Use relay modules or proper pump drivers.
- Use an external power supply suitable for the pumps.
- Connect all grounds together when required.
- Use a voltage divider before connecting battery or solar voltage to ESP32 ADC pins.
- GPIO34, GPIO35, and GPIO39 are input-only pins.
- Protect the ultrasonic sensor from direct water splash.
- Keep relay wiring separated from low-voltage signal wiring where possible.
- Use proper fuses and protection for pump power lines.

- Keep the sensor away from splashing water.
- Recalibrate full and low tank levels.

## Pump Does Not Turn ON

- Check relay power supply.
- Check relay signal pin.
- Confirm the system is not in setup mode.
- Check tank level and soil moisture values.
- Confirm saved thresholds are correct.

## Irrigation Pump Stops Immediately

- The tank may be below the low water threshold.
- The soil may already be wet.
- The ultrasonic sensor may be giving an invalid reading.
- The irrigation run time may be too short.

## Settings Are Not Changing

- Make sure the value is saved before exiting setup mode.
- Restart the device and check if the saved value is retained.
- Use reset defaults if the setup values become incorrect.

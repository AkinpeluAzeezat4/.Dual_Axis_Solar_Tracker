# NFC Card Payment System

## Overview

This project is an NFC Card Payment System built around the **ESP32-S3-DEVKIT** using a modular **PlatformIO** architecture.

The system is designed as a **prototype offline payment terminal** where:

- A user selects a transaction amount using navigation buttons
- An NFC card is tapped on the reader
- The card UID is checked against records stored on the **microSD card**
- The selected amount is deducted from the stored balance
- The transaction is logged with timestamp from the **RTC**
- A local Wi-Fi access point and web page are used to **register cards** and **top up balances**

This project is structured so that the **SD card acts as the backend** for card data and transaction logs, while the OLED provides the local user interface.

The NFC side in this version is a **prototype UID-based system** intended for development, testing, and demonstration.

# System Architecture

## Core Operation

The payment terminal works in four main stages:

1. **Amount Selection**  
   The operator uses the buttons to select the amount to charge.

2. **Card Tap**  
   The customer taps an NFC/RFID card on the reader.

3. **Balance Processing**  
   The UID is matched against the SD-stored card database and the selected amount is deducted if sufficient balance exists.

4. **Logging and Feedback**  
   The result is shown on the OLED, buzzer and LED feedback are triggered, and the transaction is written to the SD card with RTC timestamp.

## Registration and Top-Up

A simple local web server is hosted by the ESP32-S3 in Access Point mode.  
This is used to:

- register a new card
- update card owner name
- assign opening balance
- top up an existing card balance
- inspect exported card database

This keeps the device self-contained without requiring cloud services.

# Battery Voltage Divider

The battery voltage must **not** be connected directly to the ESP32-S3 ADC pin.

Use a voltage divider between the battery and the ADC input.

Example concept:

Battery+ ---- R1 ---- ADC ---- R2 ---- GND

The firmware currently uses a scaling factor for interpreted battery voltage.  
Verify the resistor values on the assembled board and adjust the scaling factor if required.

---

# OLED UI

The OLED handles the local terminal interface and includes:

- boot / welcome screen
- home screen with selected amount
- animated **TAP TO PAY** screen
- payment success / failure message screens
- card registration prompt
- battery icon
- network status icon

The display driver used in firmware is:

```cpp
U8G2_SSD1309_128X64_NONAME0_F_HW_I2C u8g2(U8G2_R0, U8X8_PIN_NONE);
```

---

# Payment Logic

The current firmware uses preset selectable payment amounts such as:

- 100
- 200
- 500
- 1000
- 2000
- 5000
- 10000

A selected amount is deducted from the card balance when a valid registered card is tapped.

If the card:
- is not registered -> registration flow is triggered
- has insufficient balance -> transaction fails
- has enough balance -> transaction succeeds and is logged

---

# SD Card Backend

The SD card is used as the local backend for:

- card database
- pending registrations
- transaction logs
- exported CSV inspection

Typical files:

- `/db/cards.csv`
- `/logs/transactions.csv`

### Example Cards Database

```csv
uid,name,balance
A1B2C3D4,Raymond,5000
B5C6D7E8,Ada,3000
```

### Example Transaction Log

```csv
timestamp,uid,name,amount,balance_after,status
2026-05-08 10:30:15,A1B2C3D4,Raymond,1000,4000,SUCCESS
2026-05-08 10:31:02,B5C6D7E8,Ada,500,2500,SUCCESS
```

---

# Local Web Server

The ESP32-S3 hosts a simple Access Point and local web dashboard for:

- register / update card
- top up balance
- inspect card database
- view selected amount and pending UID state

### Access Point
- SSID: `NFC_PAYMENT_TERMINAL`
- Password: `*****`

For public GitHub documentation, sensitive or deployment-specific values should remain hidden.

# Operating Guide

## Power On

1. Power the ESP32-S3 terminal
2. Wait for the OLED boot screen
3. Ensure SD, RTC, NFC, and display initialize correctly
4. Confirm the local AP is active if registration is needed

---

## Register a New Card

1. Tap an unregistered card on the NFC reader
2. Connect a phone or laptop to the device AP
3. Open the local web page from the terminal IP
4. In **Register / Update Card**, leave UID blank to use the pending scanned UID
5. Enter:
   - card holder name
   - opening balance
6. Save the card

---

## Top Up an Existing Card

1. Open the local web page
2. Enter the UID of the card
3. Enter the top-up amount
4. Submit the form
5. The new balance is saved to the SD database

---

## Make a Payment

1. Use the buttons to select the transaction amount
2. Press **OK**
3. Present the NFC card
4. Wait for success or failure indication
5. The result is logged automatically

---

# Status Feedback

## LED Indicator
- Breathing green -> system normal
- Solid blue -> active payment screen / waiting for card
- Solid red -> system fault

## Buzzer Feedback
- short beep -> navigation / button feedback
- success pattern -> payment success
- failure pattern -> insufficient funds or error
- register pattern -> unknown card / registration required

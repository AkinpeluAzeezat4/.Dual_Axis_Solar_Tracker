# Load Demand Response System

## Overview

This project is a modular Load Demand Response System built around the ESP32-WROOM-32 using a structured PlatformIO architecture.

The system monitors the real electrical load using a PZEM-004T v3.0 energy meter and automatically manages household loads between the inverter supply and PHCN/Grid supply based on:

- Actual measured load power
- User-configured inverter power rating
- User-configured load margin percentage
- User-configured power value for each load
- PHCN/Grid availability
- Inverter availability

The system is designed to reduce inverter overload by intelligently selecting which loads should remain on inverter and which loads should be moved to PHCN/Grid when needed.

The device includes:

- ST7920 128x64 graphical LCD display
- Rotary encoder setup menu
- PCA9555 I/O expander for relay and source sensing
- PZEM-004T v3.0 energy monitoring
- Automatic source management
- Local Wi-Fi web dashboard
- Breathing heartbeat LED
- Non-blocking firmware design

# Source Sense Logic

The firmware reads PHCN/Grid and inverter availability from the PCA9555 input pins.

The active logic is controlled in `Pins.cpp`:

```cpp
const bool SOURCE_SENSE_ACTIVE_HIGH = true;
const bool INVERTER_SENSE_ACTIVE_HIGH = true;
```

If the source-sensing circuit gives LOW when the source is available, change the values to:

```cpp
const bool SOURCE_SENSE_ACTIVE_HIGH = false;
const bool INVERTER_SENSE_ACTIVE_HIGH = false;
```

---

# Load Management Logic

The system does not depend on fixed assumed load values for its running decision.

It uses:

- Actual live power from the PZEM sensor
- User-saved inverter power rating
- User-saved load margin percentage
- User-saved load power value for each relay channel
- Real PHCN/Grid availability input
- Real inverter availability input

## Effective Inverter Limit

The effective inverter limit is calculated using:

```text
Effective Limit = Inverter Power Rating x Load Margin Percentage
```

Example:

```text
Inverter Rating = 5000 W
Load Margin = 90 %
Effective Limit = 4500 W
```

## Relay Source Meaning

```text
INVERTER = Load remains powered from inverter
PHCN     = Load is moved to grid/PHCN
```

When the load is within a safe range, the system keeps loads on inverter.

When the measured load approaches or exceeds the safe inverter limit and PHCN/Grid is available, the system selects which loads should remain on inverter and moves other loads to PHCN/Grid to protect the inverter.

If the inverter is unavailable, the system moves the loads away from inverter.

---

# LCD Operation Guide

The LCD shows two main runtime screens:

## Load Status Screen

This screen shows the source status of each load channel.

```text
INV = Load is on inverter
GRD = Load is on PHCN/Grid
```

## Consumption Screen

This screen shows live PZEM readings:

- Voltage
- Current
- Power
- Energy

The device alternates between the load status screen and the consumption screen during normal operation.

---

# Encoder Operation Guide

## First Boot Setup

If the device has not been configured before, it automatically enters setup mode.

## Boot Setup Entry

During startup, hold the encoder button within the boot window to enter setup mode.

```text
Boot window: 5 seconds
Required hold time: 3 seconds
```

## Runtime Setup Entry

During normal operation, hold the encoder button to enter setup mode.

```text
Required hold time: 5 seconds
```

## Menu Navigation

| Action | Function |
|---|---|
| Rotate encoder | Move through menu / change value |
| Press encoder | Select item / move to next setting |
| Long press encoder | Enter setup mode from runtime |

---

# Setup Menu

The setup menu contains:

- Relay Mode
- Timer Setup
- WiFi Config
- System Setup
- Exit

## Relay Mode

Relay Mode is used to set the configured power rating for each load channel.

The six load channels are configured one after another:

```text
Relay 1 Load Power
Relay 2 Load Power
Relay 3 Load Power
Relay 4 Load Power
Relay 5 Load Power
Relay 6 Load Power
```

The configured load values are saved to ESP32 Preferences memory.

## System Setup

System Setup is used to set:

- Inverter Power Rating
- Load Margin Percentage

The inverter power rating should match the real inverter capacity.

The load margin percentage defines how much of the inverter rating should be used before the system starts protecting the inverter.

## WiFi Config

WiFi Config displays the local server information.

Default Access Point:

```text
SSID: SHEMS-Controller
Password: *****
IP Address: 192.168.4.1
```

The password is masked in this README for GitHub publishing. The actual value can be changed in the local server module.

---

# Local Web Dashboard

The ESP32 creates a local Wi-Fi Access Point.

Connect a phone or laptop to the device Wi-Fi network, then open:

```text
http://192.168.4.1
```

The dashboard displays:

- Voltage
- Current
- Actual load power
- Energy
- PHCN/Grid status
- Inverter status
- Effective inverter limit
- Load-management decision
- Relay source status
- Relay configured load power values

The dashboard also allows updating the inverter rating, load margin, and relay load power values.

---

# Default Configuration

| Parameter | Default Value |
|---|---:|
| Relay 1 Load Power | 500 W |
| Relay 2 Load Power | 700 W |
| Relay 3 Load Power | 900 W |
| Relay 4 Load Power | 1200 W |
| Relay 5 Load Power | 1500 W |
| Relay 6 Load Power | 2000 W |
| Inverter Power Rating | 5000 W |
| Load Margin | 90 % |

These values can be changed from the LCD setup menu or the local web dashboard.

# Operation Flow

1. Power on the system.
2. The ESP32 initializes the LCD, encoder, PCA9555, relays, PZEM, local server, and saved configuration.
3. If the system has not been configured before, setup mode opens automatically.
4. Configure relay load power values and inverter settings.
5. During runtime, the PZEM measures actual voltage, current, power, and energy.
6. The source-sense inputs report PHCN/Grid and inverter availability.
7. The load manager checks the actual load against the inverter safe limit.
8. If the load is safe, loads remain on inverter.
9. If the inverter is close to overload and PHCN/Grid is available, selected loads are moved to PHCN/Grid.
10. The LCD and web dashboard show the current system state.

---

# Important Notes

- The PZEM must be wired correctly because the system uses it for live load decisions.
- Do not use assumed sensor values during final deployment.
- Configure the actual inverter rating before testing the load-management behavior.
- Configure each relay load power according to the real appliance connected to that load channel.
- Confirm the PHCN/Grid and inverter sense logic before connecting real loads.
- Use properly rated relays, contactors, and wiring for AC load switching.
- Use isolation and proper protection when working with mains voltage.
- The firmware is designed to be non-blocking and should not use `delay()` in the main control flow.

---

# Safety Warning

This project involves AC mains power and inverter/grid source switching. All high-voltage wiring should be handled carefully and tested with proper isolation, fusing, earthing, and protection devices.

For real installation, use correctly rated relays or contactors and ensure there is no unsafe back-feed between inverter and PHCN/Grid sources.

---
